# Introduction
In the recent and current year, the internet has become the only connection to the 
outside world for many of us, as social distancing measures are put in place. 
Recruitment platforms, in particular, has turn out to be the reliable channel for those 
of us seeking for jobs, internships and graduate programs. This has emphasised the 
importance of personal digital portfolio now more than ever, especially for those in 
Information Commutation and Technology (ICT) career.
Designing and developing a personal digital portfolio is vital now as companies and 
people continue to use the Internet to host online interviews, search for potential 
candidates, conduct meetings and even recruit people remotely even after the 
pandemic. This means it is more likely that companies will hear about you online 
before they meet you in person. In addition, recruiters, potential clients, and even new 
friends often resort to search engines to learn more about you, what you do, what you 
put out there, the values you share, and how you communicate these values. One of 
the best ways to differentiate yourself and show off the work you have done is by 
creating a personal website.
